FADE IN:

Soft music in the background.
A quiet night. Stars breathing slowly.

And in the middle of that silence… your name.

Tulip 🌷.

Today is your day.
And Pookie 🎀 wanted to give you something that feels like a moment — not just a message.

So here it is…

A scene.
A memory.
A small world built only for you.

———

SCENE ONE:
Pookie 🎀 sitting quietly,
thinking about how to say what his heart has been carrying.

“I know you're not talking to me now…  
and you only blocked me because *I* told you to —  
because I didn't want to disturb you by texting desperately.”

“I accept that things may never be the same.”

A pause. A breath.

“If I could go back in time…  
I would choose to be softer.  
More patient.  
Someone who made you feel lighter, not heavier.”

———

SCENE TWO:
Lights dim.

Pookie 🎀 remembers every moment when Tulip 🌷 smiled.
How everything around him felt different.
How her presence changed the whole air.

And he whispers the truth:

“Tulip 🌷…  
I’ve never loved anyone the way I love you.  
Not loudly.  
Not forcefully.  
Just deeply.  
Quietly.  
Honestly.”

———

SCENE THREE:
The question that has been living in his chest…

“Kya tujhe kabhi bhi…  
mere liye  
kuch bhi feel nahi hua?”

The world stops for a second.

———

SCENE FOUR:
Everything he couldn't say before,
everything he wished he had done differently…

He writes:

“I don't expect anything from you.  
Not a reply.  
Not forgiveness.  
Not anything.”

“I just want you to know…  
you were the most unexpected,  
the most beautiful part  
of my life.”

———

FADE OUT:
Roses fall slowly.
Music softens.

Final line:

“For whatever I was,
for whatever I couldn't be,
and for whatever will always remain unsaid…

Tulip 🌷,
a part of my heart ❤️ 
will always love you.”
