    <h1>For My Tulip 🌷</h1>

    <div class="letter">
        <p>Dear Tulip,</p>

        <p>
        I don’t know if you’ll read this with a smile, with silence, or with nothing at all —  
        but I still wanted to say everything I never said right.
        </p>

        <p>
        I know you’re not talking to me now, and yes… you blocked me — not because of what I felt,
        but because **I told you to**, fearing that I’d end up bothering you,
        texting you desperately, hurting you more by trying too much.
        </p>

        <p>
        And even today, when I think about it, it breaks me a little.
        Not because you blocked me…
        but because I pushed you into that position.
        </p>

        <p>
        I accept that things may never be the same again.  
        And I can’t bend time backward —  
        but if I could, Tulip…  
        I would return to the moments when everything was simple,
        when your voice felt like peace,
        when our conversations flowed without fear.
        </p>

        <p>
        I would choose to be calmer, softer, and braver in the right way.  
        I wouldn’t let my impatience hurt you.  
        I wouldn’t let my fears speak louder than my heart.
        </p>

        <p>
        You were the only person I wanted to come back to,
        even on the days I couldn’t explain myself.
        </p>

        <p>
        And today, on your birthday, I didn’t want to disturb your life —  
        but I couldn’t let the day pass without reminding you  
        how important you’ve been to me.
        </p>

        <p>
        Tulip… you have no idea how much space your presence still holds inside me.  
        I said many stupid things, acted in stupid ways,  
        but everything came from fear of losing you —  
        and ironically, that fear itself made me lose you.
        </p>

        <p>
        I don’t expect anything from you.  
        Not forgiveness.  
        Not a reply.  
        Not a comeback.  
        Nothing.
        </p>

        <p>
        This page is just something from Pookie 🎀  
        to the girl he associates with tulips —  
        soft, rare, and quietly beautiful.
        </p>

        <p>
        I miss the version of us that laughed,  
        the version that talked about nothing and everything,  
        the version where I didn’t overthink every message.
        </p>

        <p>
        And maybe this means nothing now…  
        but I still wanted you to have something special today.  
        Because no matter how far we drift,  
        you deserve gentleness —  
        even from me.
        </p>

        <p class="signature">
            Always,  
           Your Pookie 🎀
        </p>

    <div class="question">
        “I don’t know… but was there really not even a tiny moment when your heart felt something for me? Because somewhere inside, my heart still believes there was something real between us.”
